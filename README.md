# Task Distribution System

**TDS** is a personal project, developed as a part of the training programme held at my workplace. It is developed in **Python** and follows all the **OOPS** concepts. This is an initiative to learn and incoporate some of the prominent computer science concepts. I have implemented multiple design patterns such as **singleton and factory**.

The core idea behind TDS is to distribute the given tasks to be executed between multiple connected systems (nodes) and combine the executed pieces to deliver the final outcome. I am using **Python Socket API and JSON data structure** to establish communication between systems.

To store tasks, their status, outputs/erros and other node related information, methods are implemented using **Python DB API** to query the database. Designing and structring the database tables is a collective effort of me and my mentor. Mysql is the choice is DB made.
